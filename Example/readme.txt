File description:
1 -----------------------
Firstly, you must prepare a Newick format tree file, such as "Si.PME.Tree.Topology.Bootstrap.BranchLength0.nwk", "Si.PME .Tree.Topology.Bootstrap1.nwk", "Si.PME.Tree.Topology.BranchLength2.nwk" or "Si.PME.Tree.Topology3.nwk", or a control gene ID display order file, such as "Si.PME.Ordered.ID.txt".
2 -----------------------
If you want to draw a gene structure picture, you need to prepare a file in GFF3, GTF or BED format that contains the gene structure information. Then, you can utilize the file and tree file/ordered ID file to draw the gene structure picture that you want. If you don't know the file format, you can refer to "Si.PME.Structure.GFF3.txt" or "Si.PME.Structure.BED.txt".
3 -----------------------
If you want to draw a motif picture, you need to prepare a file obtained from MEME website or software. Then, you can utilize the file and tree file/ordered ID file to draw the motif picture that you want. If you don't know the file format, you can refer to "Si.PME.Motif.meme.xml" or "Si.PME.Motif.mast.xml".
4 -----------------------
If you want to draw a domain picture, you need to prepare a file obtained from Pfam or CDD website and a fasta format file containing the amino acids sequence, such as "Si.PME.Amino.acids.fasta". Then, you can utilize the files and tree file/ordered ID file to draw the domain picture that you want. If you don't know the file format, you can refer to "Si.PME.Domain.Pfam.txt" or "Si.PME.Domain.CDD.txt".
5 -----------------------
If you want to draw a promoter picture, you need to prepare a file obtained from PlantCare website and a fasta format file containing the nucleotide sequence of promoter, such as "Si.PME.Promoter.fasta". Then, you can utilize the files and tree file/ordered ID file to draw the promoter picture that you want. If you don't know the file format, you can refer to "Si.PME.PlantCare.result.txt".
6 -----------------------
If you want to draw a combination diagram of gene structure and motif, you need to prepare gene structure file and motif file. Then, you can utilize the files and tree file/ordered ID file to draw the combination picture that you want. If you don't know the file format, you can refer to 1, 2, and 3 above.
7 -----------------------
If you want to draw a combination diagram of gene structure and domain, you need to prepare gene structure file and domain file. Then, you can utilize the files and tree file/ordered ID file to draw the combination picture that you want. If you don't know the file format, you can refer to 1, 2, and 4 above.
8 -----------------------
If you want to draw a combination diagram of motif and domain, you need to prepare motif file and domain file. Then, you can utilize the files and tree file/ordered ID file to draw the combination picture that you want. If you don't know the file format, you can refer to 1, 3, and 4 above.
9 -----------------------
If you want to draw a combination diagram of gene structure, motif, and domain, you need to prepare gene structure file, motif file, and domain file. Then, you can utilize the files and tree file/ordered ID file to draw the combination picture that you want. If you don't know the file format, you can refer to 1, 2, 3, and 4 above.
10 -----------------------
If you want to add some extra information to your gene structure and motif map, you need to prepare gff format file, such as "Si.PME.Structure.and.Motif.add.gff.txt", and place the file path in the text box in the "Add other features" window.
11 -----------------------
If you want to colorize the phylogenetic tree diagram and/or add gene markers, you need to prepare control files such as "Si.PME.Tree.Classification.txt" and/or "Si.PME.Tree.Shape.before.gene.name.txt", and place the file path in the corresponding text box in the Tree edit tab.
